## Execution Flow

### Initialization

```bash
ralph ./feature.md build
```

1. Validate plan file exists
2. Determine progress file name
3. Create progress file if missing
4. Select prompt template
5. Send start notification

### The Loop

Each iteration:

```text
1. Check exit conditions
   |-- RALPH_DONE on its own line in progress file? -> Exit (build mode)
   +-- Max iterations reached? -> Exit

2. Build prompt
   +-- Substitute ${PLAN_FILE}, ${PROGRESS_FILE}, ${PLAN_NAME}

3. Execute Claude
   +-- Claude reads files, implements task, updates progress

4. Post-iteration
   |-- Plan mode? -> Exit immediately (runs once only)
   |-- Send notification (every 5 iterations, build mode only)
   |-- Sleep 2 seconds
   +-- Loop back to step 1
```

### Termination

| Exit Condition | Mode | Meaning |
|:---------------|:-----|:--------|
| Plan mode complete | Plan | Success - task list created (exits after 1 iteration) |
| `RALPH_DONE` on own line | Build | Success - all tasks complete |
| Max iterations | Both | Limit reached |
| `Ctrl+C` | Both | Manual stop |

!!! note "Detection"
    The completion marker must appear on its own line in the progress file to be detected. This prevents false positives from instructional text like "do not write RALPH_DONE" being mistakenly matched.

## Prompt Templates

### PROMPT_plan.md

Used in `plan` mode. Instructs Claude to:

1. Read and analyze the plan file
2. Explore the codebase using subagents from multiple perspectives
3. Identify what exists vs. what's needed
4. Consider all contingencies and dependencies
5. Create a prioritized task breakdown (ordered by dependencies)
6. Update progress file with analysis
7. Set status to `IN_PROGRESS` when done

!!! info "Important"
    Plan mode makes **no code changes**—analysis only. It runs once then exits automatically.

!!! warning "Critical"
    Plan mode must **NEVER** set `RALPH_DONE` under any circumstances. It always sets status to `IN_PROGRESS` when planning is complete, signaling that build mode can begin.

### PROMPT_build.md

Used in `build` mode. Instructs Claude to:

1. Read plan and progress files
2. Select ONE uncompleted task
3. Use subagents to search codebase (verify not already done)
4. Implement the task
5. Run validation (tests, build, lint)
6. Update progress file
7. Commit changes
8. Count ALL tasks - only set `RALPH_DONE` if EVERY task is [x] complete and verified

!!! info "Important"
    Build mode does **one task per iteration**.

!!! warning "Completion Rules"
    Build mode must verify ALL tasks are complete before writing `RALPH_DONE`. The marker must be written on its own line in the Status section. When in doubt, leave status as `IN_PROGRESS`—it's better to run an extra iteration than exit prematurely.

## State Management

### Fresh Context Each Iteration

Each Claude invocation starts fresh—no memory of previous iterations. The progress file is the **only** persistent state:

```markdown
# Progress: feature-name

## Status
IN_PROGRESS          <-- Controls loop

## Task List
- [x] Completed       <-- What's done
- [ ] Pending         <-- What's left

## Notes
- Discoveries         <-- Knowledge transfer
```

### Why Fresh Context?

| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **No overflow** | Long sessions don't degrade |
| **Clean slate** | No accumulated confusion |
| **Explicit state** | Everything written down |
| **Debuggable** | Progress shows what happened |

## Variable Substitution

| Variable | Example |
|:---------|:--------|
| `${PLAN_FILE}` | `/home/user/repo/feature.md` |
| `${PROGRESS_FILE}` | `feature_PROGRESS.md` |
| `${PLAN_NAME}` | `feature` |

## Notifications

### Flow

```text
notify.sh
    |
    |---> Slack (webhook)
    |---> Discord (webhook)
    |---> Telegram (bot API)
    +---> Custom (your script)
```

Messages sent to **all** configured platforms. Unconfigured platforms silently skipped.

### Custom Script Interface

```bash
$1 = "Ralph Started\nPlan: feature\nMode: build"
```

Your script handles delivery. Exit code ignored.

## Files

```text
~/ralph/
|-- ralph.sh               # Orchestration loop
|-- notify.sh              # Notification dispatcher
|-- setup-notifications.sh # Setup wizard
|-- PROMPT_plan.md         # Plan mode prompt
|-- PROMPT_build.md        # Build mode prompt
|-- .env.example           # Config template
+-- docs/                  # Documentation
```

## Security

### dangerously-skip-permissions

Ralph uses `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions`:

- Allows any command execution
- Skips confirmation prompts
- Enables autonomous operation

!!! danger "Warning"
    Use with caution. Review commits. Set max-iterations for unattended runs.

### Credential Protection

- `.gitignore` blocks `.env*` files
- Config stored in `~/.ralph.env` (outside repo)
- Wizard sets `chmod 600` on config
- No credentials in prompt templates
